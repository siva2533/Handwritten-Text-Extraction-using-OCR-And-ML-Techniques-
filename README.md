The link for dataset we used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karmukilandk/tamil-handwritten-dataset?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=kaggle-dataset-share&ut
We used train and validation datasets for training purpose and test dataset for prediction purpose.
The file paths in the code are according to our actual file path.
we used ASUS TUF Gaming F15, Intel Core i7-13620H 13th Gen, Gaming Laptop (16GB RAM/512GB SSD/RTX 4050/Windows 11) for this process
The training time is approximately 3-5 hours while plugged in charger.
Just change the file path of dataset to your path for any language.
Also it work fine with sentences , unfortunately we had fewer sentence dataset we are not able to attain good results,so ended up this in word level only,
And also this our final semester project during our UG BE ECE.
